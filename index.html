        <div class="row">
          We started this app in order to make a difference in the world. We
          want to help people find their career path and make the right choices.
          This was started as a school project for BCIT.

        <h2>Our goal</h2>
        <div class="row">
          Our goal is to help people find their career path and make the right
          choices. We want to make a difference in the world and help people
          achieve their dreams. We know it's hard to choose a career path,
          especially for young people, hard to know what you're getting yourself
          into.

        <h2>How we'll do it</h2>
        <div class="row">
          We will achieve this by getting you to do a personalisation survey to
          best match you with a career. You will be able to check the latest
          news of your selected career as well as talk to professionals in the
          field and see what companies are looking for.
