            We started this app in order to make a difference in the world. We
            want to help people find their career path and make the right
            choices. This was started as a school project for BCIT.

          <h2>Our goal</h2>
          <div class="row">
            Our goal is to help people find their career path and make the right
            choices. We want to make a difference in the world and help people
            achieve their dreams. We know it's hard to choose a career path,
            especially for young people, hard to know what you're getting
            yourself into.

          <h2>How we'll do it</h2>
          <div class="row">
            We will achieve this by getting you to do a personalisation survey
            to best match you with a career. You will be able to check the
            latest news of your selected career as well as talk to professionals
            in the field and see what companies are looking for.
